# Eacademy Front end project.

This is an elearning platform developed as part of the Codaisseur full-stack javascript course final projects. You can visit and use [the live app here](https://mystifying-wilson-1474e2.netlify.app)

## Goals of this project

The main goal of this project is to approach building an application in a Skateboard MVP way, following small steps and reaching certain kind of release through small iterations.

> I aimed to complete 5 releases in 10 days, and I managed to complete 4, sleeping isn't is something you can replace by using darkmode in VScode.

The releases were planned and organized trying to maximize the Return Of Investment in an early stage startup.

- **_Step 1_**. 🛹 See product and brand traction by creating a fake shop that collects usage and tracktion metrics with Google Data Studio through the data layer. [Release 0.1 can be found here](https://github.com/migueldf10/eacademy-gatsby-react-redux/releases/tag/0.1).
- **_Step 2_**. 🛴 Gather a deeper level of usage with account creations and abandonned checkouts. Even more important than traction is data collection. The purpose of this step is to start building an audience via Accounts created and abanonned checkouts to start selling straightaway after building the content. [Release 0.2 can be found here](https://github.com/migueldf10/eacademy-gatsby-react-redux/releases/tag/0.2)
- **_Step 3_**. 🚲Once content is created, students need basic functionality to check how they interact with the platform. In [the 0.3 Release](https://github.com/migueldf10/eacademy-gatsby-react-redux/releases/tag/0.3) students can access the student area and mark lessons as Review later and mark them as completed, so they can follow courses and give feedback about the lessons that need review.
- **_Step 4_**. 🛵In [the release 0.4](https://github.com/migueldf10/eacademy-gatsby-react-redux/releases/tag/0.4) the app shows certain branding and solves lots of usability issues. Since this is the first one that operates 100% in production, has it's own CMS for admins to create and edit content.

- **_Step 5_** 🏎️ Real time payments using stripe, authorized files & video, advanced marketing integration. Not ready yet.
